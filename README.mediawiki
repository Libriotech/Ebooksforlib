=Ebooksforlib=

Ebooksforlib is an ebook portal for libraries. 

==Overview==

* Let patrons log in with their ordinary library credentials
* Discover ebooks through browsing or searching
* Borrow ebooks

Preparation of ebooks for reading as well as a browser-based web-app for reading the books will be provided by related projects. 

==MySQL config==

Search is based on MySQL FULLTEXT indexing, and this probably works better if you turn off stopwords. You might also want to consider allowing search terms as short as 3 chars. 

On Debian, add the following to /etc/mysql/my.cnf:

# Disable stopwords
ft_stopword_file=""
# Make it possible to search for 3 letter words
ft_min_word_len=3

Then restart MySQL.
